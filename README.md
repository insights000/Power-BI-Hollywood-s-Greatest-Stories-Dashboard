**Data Visualisation and Dashboard Presentation: Power BI**
The second part of the task assigned to us for the Level Data Technician bootcamp was to then import the cleaned data from R studio regarding Hollywood's Greatest stories set into a CSV and then create a dashboard on Power BI to reflect the following:

•	The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre
•	The number of movies produced per year. 
•	The audience scores for each film.  
•	The profitability per studio 
•	The worldwide gross per genre 

Thus reflected in this dashboard, using my own creative set of data visualisation techniques merged with clever shadowing to produce a blue and green easy to read palette, light shades of brown with a title and a theme that suited the context of the data, using different visualisations to achieve efficency to discrimiante between the different statistis that were being analysed here.
